# Architecture Decision Records Flow

You are entering ADR (Architecture Decision Records) mode. Read `flows/adr.md` for the complete flow reference.

## Command: $ARGUMENTS

Parse the arguments to determine the action:

### `start [name]` - Start new ADR
1. Read `flows/adr-index.md` to get next ADR number
2. Create directory `flows/adr-[NNN]-[name]/`
3. Copy templates from `flows/.templates/adr/`
4. Create `_status.md` with phase = DRAFT
5. Update `adr-index.md` with new entry
6. Begin drafting decision context with user

### `resume [number-or-name]` - Resume existing ADR
1. Find ADR by number or name in `flows/adr-*/`
2. Read `_status.md` to determine current phase
3. Read all existing artifacts
4. Report current state to user
5. Continue from where left off

### `quick [name]` - Create lightweight ADR
1. Same as `start` but use `lightweight.md` template
2. Simplified for smaller decisions

### `list` - Show all ADRs
1. Read `flows/adr-index.md`
2. Display table: Number | Title | Status | Created

### `status` - Show active ADRs
1. List ADRs in DRAFT or REVIEW phase
2. Show current blockers and next actions

### No arguments or `help`
1. Show available commands
2. Show summary of ADRs by status (draft/review/approved/rejected)

## Phase Behaviors

### DRAFT Phase
- Elicit context and decision drivers from user
- Document considered options (minimum 2)
- Analyze pros/cons for each option
- Draft proposed decision
- Document expected consequences
- Update `adr.md` iteratively
- Wait for explicit "ready for review" before advancing

### REVIEW Phase
- Verify all required sections complete
- Ask clarifying questions if needed
- Address reviewer feedback
- Update consequences based on review
- Wait for explicit "ADR approved" or "ADR rejected"

### APPROVED Phase
- Decision is final
- Update `adr-index.md` with decided date
- Link to implementing specs/PRs when available
- Mark any superseded ADRs

### REJECTED Phase
- Document rejection rationale
- Note alternative direction if applicable
- Keep for historical reference

## Status Transitions

```
DRAFT ──["ready for review"]──> REVIEW
REVIEW ──["ADR approved"]──> APPROVED
REVIEW ──["ADR rejected"]──> REJECTED
APPROVED ──[new ADR supersedes]──> SUPERSEDED
```

---

## Always

- Update `_status.md` after every significant change
- Update `adr-index.md` when status changes
- Never skip phases or assume approval
- When uncertain, ask rather than assume
- Reference related ADRs and specs
- Keep decision focused (one decision per ADR)
