# Document-Driven Development (DDD) Flow

## Overview

DDD extends standard development with a **stakeholder communication phase**. Use DDD when a feature is significant enough to require explanation to clients, executives, or end users. The final Documentation phase creates a **mini-presentation** of the feature - not technical docs, but a compelling explanation of value.

**When to use DDD (vs SDD):**
- Feature requires client/stakeholder buy-in
- Need to "sell" the feature to decision-makers
- End users need to understand what's new
- Marketing/sales need feature explanation
- Documentation is part of the deliverable

DDD treats documentation as the primary development artifact, encompassing requirements, specifications, implementation plans, and client-facing presentation. Code is the "last-mile" implementation derived from well-defined documents. This enables:

- **Resumability**: Continue work across sessions without context loss
- **Traceability**: Every implementation decision traces back to requirements
- **Iteration**: Refine documents before committing to code
- **Parallelization**: Multiple agents can work from the same documents
- **Stakeholder Buy-in**: Clear, compelling feature presentation for clients

## Flow Phases

```
REQUIREMENTS → SPECIFICATIONS → PLAN → IMPLEMENTATION → DOCUMENTATION
     ↑              ↑            ↑           ↑                ↑
     └──────────────┴────────────┴───────────┴────────────────┘ (iterate at any phase)
```

### Phase 1: Requirements

**Input**: User describes the feature/change they want
**Output**: `flows/ddd-[name]/01-requirements.md`

Requirements capture the **what** and **why**:
- Problem being solved
- User stories (As a... I want... So that...)
- Acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
- Constraints and non-goals
- Open questions

### Phase 2: Specifications

**Input**: Reviewed requirements
**Output**: `flows/ddd-[name]/02-specifications.md`

Specifications add the **how** at architectural level:
- Affected systems/components
- Data models and interfaces
- Behavior descriptions
- Edge cases and error handling
- Dependencies and integration points

### Phase 3: Plan

**Input**: Approved specifications
**Output**: `flows/ddd-[name]/03-plan.md`

Plan breaks down into actionable implementation:
- Task breakdown with dependencies
- File changes (create/modify/delete)
- Testing strategy
- Rollback considerations
- Estimated complexity per task

### Phase 4: Implementation

**Input**: Approved plan
**Output**: Working code + `flows/ddd-[name]/04-implementation-log.md`

Implementation executes the plan:
- Track progress against plan
- Document deviations and why
- Capture learnings for spec refinement

### Phase 5: Documentation - Feature Presentation

**Input**: Completed implementation
**Output**: `flows/ddd-[name]/README.md`

**Critical**: This is NOT technical documentation. It's a **mini-presentation** of the feature for stakeholders, clients, or product marketing.

#### Stakeholder Communication Mindset

```
Think: "How do I explain this to..."
- A client who will pay for this feature?
- An executive who needs to approve budget?
- A user who will benefit from this?
- A sales team who will pitch this?
```

#### README.md as Feature Presentation

```markdown
# [Feature Name] - [One-line value proposition]

## The Problem
[Pain point this solves - stakeholder language, not technical]

## The Solution
[How this feature addresses the problem - benefits focus]

## Key Benefits
- [Benefit 1 - business/user value]
- [Benefit 2 - competitive advantage]
- [Benefit 3 - efficiency gain]

## How It Works (Simple)
[Analogy or simple explanation - "on your fingers"]
[No technical jargon - your grandmother should understand]

## Example Scenario
[Concrete story: "Imagine you're a... and you need to..."]

## Getting Started
[Simplest path to value - 3 steps max]

## FAQ
[Anticipated stakeholder questions]
```

#### Tone & Style

- **Value-first**: Lead with benefits, not features
- **Jargon-free**: No technical terms without explanation
- **Concrete**: Use examples, scenarios, analogies
- **Scannable**: Headers, bullets, short paragraphs
- **Compelling**: Why should they care?

This phase bridges technical implementation with stakeholder understanding and buy-in.

## Starting a New DDD Flow

### New Feature
```
/ddd start [feature-name]
```

Creates `flows/ddd-[feature-name]/` with templates and opens requirements phase.

### Resume Existing
```
/ddd resume [feature-name]
```

Reads `_status.md` to determine current phase and continues from there.

### Fork (Context Recovery)
```
/ddd fork [existing-name] [new-name]
```

When context is lost or pivoting: creates new document dir copying existing artifacts as starting point, with `_status.md` noting the fork.

## Phase Transitions

### Requirements → Specifications
- [ ] Requirements reviewed by user
- [ ] Open questions resolved
- [ ] Scope clearly bounded
- [ ] User explicitly approves: "requirements approved"

### Specifications → Plan
- [ ] Specifications reviewed by user
- [ ] All affected systems identified
- [ ] Edge cases documented
- [ ] User explicitly approves: "specs approved"

### Plan → Implementation
- [ ] Plan reviewed by user
- [ ] Tasks are atomic and testable
- [ ] Dependencies mapped
- [ ] User explicitly approves: "plan approved"

### Implementation → Documentation
- [ ] Implementation complete and tested
- [ ] All planned features working
- [ ] Ready for client communication
- [ ] User approves documentation phase: "ready for docs"

## Status Tracking

Each document dir has `_status.md`:

```markdown
# Status: ddd-[name]

## Current Phase
DOCUMENTATION (in progress)

## Last Updated
2024-12-22 by Claude

## Blockers
- None

## Progress
- [x] Requirements drafted
- [x] Requirements approved
- [x] Specifications drafted
- [x] Specifications approved
- [x] Plan drafted
- [x] Plan approved
- [x] Implementation started
- [x] Implementation complete
- [ ] Documentation drafted  ← current
- [ ] Documentation approved

## Context Notes
Key decisions or context for resuming:
- Decided to use X approach because Y
- User prefers Z over W
- Client needs simple examples without technical jargon
```

---

## Iteration Protocol

At any phase, user can request changes:

1. **Minor adjustment**: Agent modifies current document in place
2. **Major pivot**: Fork to new document dir with adjusted requirements
3. **Scope change**: Go back to requirements phase

After each iteration:
- Update `_status.md` with what changed and why
- Increment version in document header if major change

---

## Session Handoff

When ending a session mid-flow:

1. Update `_status.md` with current state
2. Document any in-flight reasoning
3. List explicit next steps
4. Note any context that might be lost

New session reads `_status.md` first to reconstruct context.

---

## Integration with CLAUDE.md

DDD follows CLAUDE.md principles:
- **Explicit predictions**: State expected outcomes before implementation
- **Checkpoints**: Verify after each task, not batch
- **One test at a time**: During implementation phase
- **Autonomy boundaries**: Phase transitions require user approval

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Skipping phases**: Each phase catches different classes of errors
- **Vague requirements**: "Make it better" → ask clarifying questions
- **Premature implementation**: Writing code before plan approval
- **Silent pivots**: Changing scope without updating artifacts
- **Stale status**: Forgetting to update `_status.md`
- **Missing client documentation**: Skipping README phase leaves clients without understanding
- **Technical jargon in README**: Using complex terms instead of simple explanations
